# Heart-Attack-Risk-Prediction-Using-Data-Analytics-Machine-Learning
This project analyzes a heart attack risk dataset to identify key clinical and lifestyle factors associated with heart attack risk. Using data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and multiple statistical and machine learning models, the study highlights age, cholesterol, BMI, diet, blood pressure, and family history as the strongest predictors. The project demonstrates an end-to-end healthcare analytics workflow.
